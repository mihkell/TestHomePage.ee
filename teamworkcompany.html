WORK IN PROGRESS
<H1>New Model of Company Arhitecture in IT services</H1>
<ul>
  <li>First to accept this model one should realize that compensation should be given for <strong>work</strong> an <strong>risk</strong>.</li>
  <li>Second one should see that people creating a company that builds IT products to customers - in higher level rents workforce - has little monetary risk.</li>
</ul>

For example how this model works.
Compensation can be given for:

<ol>
  <li><sup>*</sup>Starting the company</li>
  <li>Leading the comapany</li>
  <li>Leading a team</li>
  <li>Seniority</li>
  <li>Improving processes</li>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Sales</li>
</ol>
<div style="font-size: small"><sup>*</sup> - Starting a company should have a fixed sum compensation that makes sense in the business environment.
  Creating a IT services company require little risk and therefore it makes sense to make the compensation equal to few months worth of
  salary.
</div>
<p>
  For all these points you can give a specific number how much they should earn.
  If the business environment gives a chance for additional income it will be divided between all these rolls.
</p>
<p>

Idea is to remove people who earn money from the work of others with out a good reason.
In the era of IT the risk that owners take when they make a new IT services company is minimal - at maximum they risk with 2 months salary.
In old times - and even now in some industries - owners invest considerable capital into a company before workers even can start their work. In those cases the long term divided payments could make sense.

In companies that provide IT services this risk capital is so small that it doesn't explain why owners should be able to get perpetuity on work of others.
</p>
<p>This model will set it clear that everybody can get the compensation that others get if they do the work that others are doing.</p>
<p>This model will remove the environment from the company where owners want to minimize what workers make to make bigger profits from them.</p>
