WORK IN PROGRESS
<H1>New Model of Company Arhitecture in IT services</H1>

<p>
  This business model is meant for companies that rent workforce or provide software development outsourcing. The aim is to fix the
  compensation model currently prevailing in the industry.
  <br><br>
  With currently prevailing business models workers and owners are at odds with one another.
  Owners have incentive to reduce wages to the minimum, and workers have incentive to do as little work as possible.
  <br><br>
  In many business sectors the capital investment of owners is significant but starting an IT services company requires little starting
  capital. However the model how owners are compensated is the same.
  <br><br>
  When we start IT services company it's very clear with what the owners are risking. Their risk is equal to the amount of unpaid work they are
  willing to invest before they decide that they failed or they succeeded.
  <br><br>
  The capital needed to invest by the owners is very quantifiable therefore we don't need to pay them a perpetuity. We should instead pay a reasonable amount for
  the <strong>work</strong> that starting a company requires. After the members of the company have compensated the founders then the owners shouldn't get any more money for the fact that they are the de facto owners of it.
</p>

<p>
  The model's basic statment is that <strong>in a company we should compensate work</strong>. The money left after paying compensations should be considered as "market fluctuations"/"market opportunity benefit" and divided between workers.
  <br><br>
  All the things that need to be done in a company should be defined as work.
  This creates a situation where somebody who wants the benefits/salary of their team member is only required to be able to perform those tasks.
</p>

<H2>The Model</H2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>*Compensate activities that benefit company</strong> - idealy you compensate only/mostly work. (Starting a company is work also. I'd suggest to set a fixed number how much this costs. E.g. founders risk with 2 month of compensation plus they work extra hours that need to be compensated with 10x. When company succeeds then the new workers will have to pay that sum back to owners, over some period.)</li>
  <li>Compenstaion should be <strong>fixed sum </strong> and <strong>not perpetuity</strong> </li>
  <li>People in a team get the income of the project. E.g. If project managers negotiate an increase of $/h the benefits go to the team members.</li>
</ol>
<sub>* - Seniority is also compensatable.</sub>

<p>UNSTRUCTURED NOTES (Don't read.)</p>
problem:
1. All places in a company are not equally reachable.
2. People in a company do not work as a team, because owners have incentive to reduce the compensation of their workforce to the minimum possible.
3. Having a layer of owners in a company creates the situation where they can use the peoples willingness to work as a team to their benefit not to the benefit of the team.

-----
<ul>
  <li>First to accept this model one should realize that compensation should be given for <strong>work</strong> an <strong>risk</strong>.
  </li>
  <li>Second one should see that people creating a company that builds IT products to customers - in higher level rents workforce - has
    little monetary risk.
  </li>
</ul>

For example how this model works.
Compensation can be given for:

<ol>
  <li><sup>*</sup>Starting the company</li>
  <li>Leading the comapany</li>
  <li>Leading a team</li>
  <li>Seniority</li>
  <li>Improving processes</li>
  <li>Programming</li>
  <li>Sales</li>
</ol>
<div style="font-size: small"><sup>*</sup> - Starting a company should have a fixed sum compensation that makes sense in the business
  environment.
  Creating a IT services company require little risk and therefore it makes sense to make the compensation equal to few months worth of
  salary.
</div>
<p>
  For all these points you can give a specific number how much they should earn.
  If the business environment gives a chance for additional income it will be divided between all these rolls.
</p>
<p>

  Idea is to remove people who earn money from the work of others with out a good reason.
  In the era of IT the risk that owners take when they make a new IT services company is minimal - at maximum they risk with 2 months
  salary.
  In old times - and even now in some industries - owners invest considerable capital into a company before workers even can start their
  work. In those cases the long term divided payments could make sense.

  In companies that provide IT services this risk capital is so small that it doesn't explain why owners should be able to get perpetuity on
  work of others.
</p>
<p>This model will set it clear that everybody can get the compensation that others get if they do the work that others are doing.</p>
<p>This model will remove the environment from the company where owners want to minimize what workers make to make bigger profits from
  them.</p>
